<h1>Memphis Homicide Heatmap (2010-2024)</h1>

### Date:
July 2024

### Source:

### Background/Context:
Heatmaps are often used with crime data to identify hotspots. I wanted to create a heatmap of Memphis homicides with over a decades worth of data.

### Objective:
Create a heatmap and gain insights on crime hotspots in Memphis with over a decades worth of homicide data.

<h2>Output:</h2>

We can see that several parts of the city have considerable amounts of red clustering. Downtown, South Memphis, and North Memphis directly outside of downtown being the biggest hotspots.
Other parts such as Hollywood, Whitehaven, Orange Mound, Parkway Village, and Hickory Hill all very high crime areas as well.
Midtown and East Memphis, particularly along Poplar Ave seem to be the safest parts within the city limits.

<h2>Further Research:</h2>
<br />
Beyond the heatmap output itself, I was able to create custom fields that help drive more insights like the count of homicides within a given selected area.

I was also able to run several select by location queries with boundaries that I had previously made to gain insights.

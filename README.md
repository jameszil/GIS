## Highlights & key concepts used in these projects:

### Remote Sensing and Image Analysis
- Exporting raster data from USGS
- Setting Landsat 8 Band Combinations for analysis via Semi-Automatic Classification

### Layer Manipulation
- Build virtual layer
- Editing shapes with vertex tool
- Combining layers using mosaics and MMQGIS
- Trimming layers by clipping mask layer
- Removing raster gaps with fill nodata
- Creating new shapefiles with ID key
- Add buffers and centroids analysis
- Distance analysis point to point

### Plugins
- Querying roads, buildings, boundaries via QuickOSM and OSMDownloader
- Publishing interactive web map of countries by GDP PPP and Development Group with OpenLayers and Leaflet using qgis2web
- Creating 3D elevation intrusion models and animation using Qgis2threejs
- Tiles and basemaps using QuickMapServices

### Projection Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
- Change coordinate projections for layers and projects
- Project defined scales for easy navigation
- Georeferencing and mapping cities without latitude and longitude data
- Mapping with latitude and longitude fields

### Data Manipulation, Querying, Joins, Adding Data
- Creating calculated fields in attribute table
- Concatenating fields to create unique identifiers for connections
- Join by attribute, to nearest, by expression, etc.
- Writing queries in attribute table to select features using an expression
- Select points and extract by location within other polygon layer
- Changing data types with refactor layer
- Using query builder to filter on specific layers
- Selecting specific values and adding as new layer
- Adding via delimited text layer and joining attributes by field value

### Symbology
- Graduated and categorized symbology for visualization
- Grouping, classes, color legend, breaks and intervals
- Rendering, blend modes, opacity, layer order

### Dynamic Labeling and Design
- Scale dependent visibility rendering
- Map units, drop shadow, contour lines
- Inverted polygons outline of layer
- Text buffer and placement
- Creating dropdown list for fields using Value Map Widget
- Print layouts and legends for exporting clear visualizations

### Summary
- Using geoprocessing tools in GIS software for data preparation.
- Performing spatial analysis on points, lines, and polygons data to gain insights into patterns and relationships.
- Proficiency in creating informative maps, graphs, and charts to aid in problem-solving.
- Ability in crafting informative maps, graphs, and charts to facilitate problem-solving.
- Beginning to end projects starting from downloading from data from city data hubs, cleaning and scrubbing data, importing into GIS software, querying data, designing symbology and legends, to delivering insights through map visualizations.

### Other Steps
- inverted polygons outline of country
- refactor fields - change data type
- add delimited text layer
- join text file
- advanced labeling, placement, text buffer, drop shadow
- label rendering, scale dependent visibility
- create separate layer centroids for labeling, remove symbology, add label buffer and placement
- exporting file dimensions high quality
- concatenate strings
- queries in attribute table
- fixed cities multiple countries by concat country code to city, creating unique keys to join tables
- change projections, project properties, project defined scales for world
- mouse click pan, map swipe
- create animation swing
- create 3D intrusion map
- source query builder to filter
- map units for changing size zoom
- new print layout, edit map extent
- attribute from properties, widget type, value map, load from layer, select field for dropdown box 
- map cities without lat and long

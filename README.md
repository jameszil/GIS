## Highlights & key concepts used in these projects:

### Remote Sensing and Image Analysis
- Exporting raster data from USGS
- Setting Landsat 8 Band Combinations for analysis via Semi-Automatic Classification

### Layer Manipulation
- Build virtual layer
- Editing shapes with vertex tool
- Combining layers using mosaics and MMQGIS
- Trimming layers by clipping mask layer
- Removing raster gaps with fill nodata
- Creating new shapefiles with ID key
- Add buffers and centroids analysis
- Distance analysis point to point

### Plugins
- Querying roads, buildings, boundaries via QuickOSM and OSMDownloader
- Publishing interactive web map of countries by GDP PPP and Development Group with OpenLayers and Leaflet using qgis2web
- Creating 3D elevation intrusion models and animation using Qgis2threejs
- Tiles and basemaps using QuickMapServices

### Projection Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
- Change coordinate projections for layers and projects
- Project defined scales for easy navigation
- Georeferencing and mapping cities without latitude and longitude data
- Mapping with latitude and longitude fields

### Data Manipulation, Querying, Joins, Adding Data
- Creating calculated fields in attribute table
- Concatenating fields to create unique identifiers for connections
- Join by attribute, to nearest, by expression, etc.
- Writing queries in attribute table to select features using an expression
- Select points and extract by location within other polygon layer
- Changing data types with refactor layer
- Using query builder to filter on specific layers
- Selecting specific values and adding as new layer
- Adding via delimited text layer and joining attributes by field value

### Symbology
- Graduated and categorized symbology for visualization
- Grouping, classes, color legend, breaks and intervals
- Rendering, blend modes, opacity, layer order

### Dynamic Labeling and Design
- Scale dependent visibility rendering
- Map units, drop shadow, contour lines
- Inverted polygons outline of layer
- Text buffer and placement
- Creating dropdown list for fields using Value Map Widget
- Print layouts and legends for exporting clear visualizations

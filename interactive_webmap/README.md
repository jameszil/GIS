<h1>Interactive Webmap</h1>

### Date:
May 2024

### Background/Context:
I often wonder what a country's HDI score and development group are while looking at other related metrics like GDP PPP for example.
In the past I have searched for each individually and flipped back and forth between the two or put the maps side by side to compare the outputs.

### Objective:
Create and interactive web map that displays countries by GDP PPP that also displays the HDI score and development group when hovering over with cursor.

<h2>Output:</h2>

#### *Open index.html in qgis2web folder*

I merged the GDP PPP with countries HDI score and development group into the same shapefile to display all this information using one layer. I then used the qgis2web plugin in QGIS to create a web map of this data.
